1.) Internal Storage -> By default, files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them. When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed/deleted. 
External Storage -> The external storage is more like a public storage, so for now, it's the sdcard, but could become any other type of storage (remote hard drive, or anything else).

2.)Data resides in the cache till the app is installed on user device...

3.)Normal Permissions -> Permissions which are not required to be granted by the user at run time.It only requires to mention in app manifest. For ex--> ACCESS_NETWROK_STATE
 Crictical Permissions -> Permissions which are required to be granted by the user at run time. For ex-> READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
